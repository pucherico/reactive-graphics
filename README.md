# reactive-graphics

A minimal opinionated graphic engine based on rxjs.

[DRAFT DOCUMENT...]

***Reactive Graphics*** is a library for creating 2D graphics and animations using the Canvas API, with capabilities for interactions. The library is strongly based on Rxjs (as its unique dependency) offering a variety of Rxjs operators to develop animations easily.

Another facility the library provides is *Modelling*, leveraging the Canvas API for building graphic blocks in a more declaratively way and using compositions.

## Main features

### Graphics

* Using Canvas API directly
* Graphics modelling:
  * Composition
  * Geometric transformations

### Animations

* Effects
* Transitions

### Layers

* Control groups of graphics
* Layer features:
  * Geometric transformations
  * Visibility
  * Sensitivity

### Interaction

* Input devices
* Contacts
* Collisions

### Frame control

* Pace
* Pause/sleep
